### Tools Used
The electronic design and development were done using KiCad, an open-source EDA software. The version used for this project is KiCad 8.0.7.

#### The footprints of all the Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, LED is **"0402_1005Metric_Pad0.72x0.64mm_HandSolder"**

All the files are attached in the repository's folder

The custom library was created to import certain symbols into the schmatic and its correrponding footprint also its corresponding 3D Models

The name of the library is:  
**myLibrary.kicad_sym**   : for symbols  
__myLibrary.pretty__      : for footprints
